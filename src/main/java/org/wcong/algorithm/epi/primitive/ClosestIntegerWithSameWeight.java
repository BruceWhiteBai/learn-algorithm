 * Define the weight of a non-negative integer x to be the number of bits that are set to 1 in its binary representation
 * Write a program which takes as input a non-negative integer x and
 * returns a number y which is not equal to x,
 * but has the same weight as x and their difference, |y - x|, is as small as possible.
 * You can assume x is not 0, or all Is. For example, if x = 6, you should return 5.

 * 1 brute force O(2^n)
 * 2 greed  O(n)   find the first different bit
