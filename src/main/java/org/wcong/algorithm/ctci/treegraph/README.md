### Basic
tree and graph

### Tree
1. Tree vs Binary Tree
2. Binary Search Tree vs Binary Tree
3. Balanced Tree vs Unbalanced Tree
4. Complete Binary Tree

#### Binary Tree Traversal
1. Pre-Order
2. In-Order  : visit the tree in ascending order like a array
3. Post-Order

#### Heap
a heap is a complete binary tree
1. add: add to bottom  and bubble up
2. extract: take first and swap with bottom, then bubble down

#### Trie

### Graph
* a tree is a connect graph without circle
* a graph is simply a collections of nodes and edge between them

#### types of graph
1. directed and undirected
2. connected and isolated
3. cycles and acyclic 

#### represents
1. adjacency list
2. adjacency matrix

#### graph search 
*if visited*, **
1. BFS 
2. DFS
3. Bidirectional Search: two BFS from two node
