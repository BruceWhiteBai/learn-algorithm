### Basic
this is about design, oo design and system design

### OO Design
#### how to approach
1. handle ambiguity: who, what, where, when, how, why
2. define the core object
3. analysis relationships
4. investigate actions

#### Design Pattern

### System Design
#### Key Concept
1. horizontal and vertical scaling
2. load balance: route and node aware
3. database none join and nosql
4. database partition
    1. vertical partition
    2. key-base partition
    3. directory-base partition
5. caching
6. asynchronous processing and queue
7. networking metrics
    1. brand width
    2. through put
    3. latency
8. map reduce

#### considerations
1. failures
2. availability and reliability
3. read-heavy and write-heavy
4. security

#### Step By Step
1. scope the problem: findWord, ask input output ,what kind of data ,how we use it
2. make reasonable assumptions
3. draw the major assumptions
4. identify the key issues
5. redesign
