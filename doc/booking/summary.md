### What is that
Recently I have an interview in booking. 
After technical interview, interviewer said my communication isn't quite well mostly because i'm not native speaker.
So they ask me to prepare more about english.

Here is my preparation plan, because every project has a plan right?
1. read cracking the interview twice.
2. summary all the questions
3. answer the question in all different ways
4. repeat the answer and remember the basic items, remember **repeat** is the key

some key aspect
1. literally read
2. record every word important

Here is my schedule, I plan two week is the deadline, every week a loop
1. mar 24- mar 25 read through the book, record
2. mar 26- mar 30 answer all the question in different ways
3. mar 31- apr 1  read through the book twice
4. repeat the questions
5. read the book one more time, and try the second time

ok lets begin
