### questions
* Add Without Plus: Write a function that adds two numbers. You should not use or any arithmetic operators.
* Shuffle: Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards. It must be a perfect shuffle-in other words, each
  of the 52! permutations of the deck has to be equally likely. Assume that you are given a random
  number generator which is perfect.
* Random Set: Write a method to randomly generate a set of m integers from an array of size n. Each
  element must have equal probability of being chosen.
* Missing Number: An array A contains all the integers from Oto n, except for one number which
  is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The
  elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch
  the jth bit of A[ i ],"which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do
  it inO(n) time?
* Letters and Numbers: Given an array filled with letters and numbers, find the longest subarray with
  an equal number of letters and numbers.
* Count of 2s: Write a method to count the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between O
  and n (inclusive).
