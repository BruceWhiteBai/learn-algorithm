### questions
* Volume of Histogram: Imagine a histogram (bar graph). Design an algorithm to compute the
  volume of water it could hold if someone poured water across the top. You can assume that each
  histogram bar has width 1.
* Word Transformer: Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary, write a method to
  transform one word into another word by changing only one letter at a time. The new word you get
  in each step must be in the dictionary.
* Max Black Square: Imagine you have a square matrix, where each cell (pixel) is either black or white
  Design an algorithm to find the maximum subsquare such that all four borders are filled with black
  pixels.
* Max Submatrix: Given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, write code to find the
  submatrix with the largest possible sum.
* Word Rectangle: Given a list of millions of words, design an algorithm to create the largest possible
  rectangle of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms
  a word (reading top to bottom). The words need not be chosen consecutively from the list but all
  rows must be the same length and all columns must be the same height.
