### Summary

### Key Points
* have brute-force solutions use 0(n) space, but subtler solutions use the itself reduce to 0(1)
    * *org.wcong.algorithm.epi.array.onedimension.DutchNationalFlagProblem*
* Filling an array from the front is slow, so see if it's possible to write values from the back.
    * *org.wcong.algorithm.epi.array.onedimension.MultiplyArbitraryInteger* 
* Instead of deleting an entry (which requires moving all entries to its right), consider overwriting it.
    * *org.wcong.algorithm.epi.array.onedimension.DeleteDuplicatesInSortedArray*
* Be comfortable with writing code that operates on subarrays.
    * *org.wcong.algorithm.epi.array.onedimension.NextPermutation*
* It's incredibly easy to make off-by-1 errors when operating on arrays.
    * *org.wcong.algorithm.epi.array.onedimension.AdvanceThroughArray*
* Don't worry about preserving the integrity of the array (sortedness, keeping equal entries together, etc.) until it is time to return
*
